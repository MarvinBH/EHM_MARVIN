Abstract: This study investigates the impact of U.S. economic policy uncertainty (EPU) on its economy and how EPU and the economy influence the housing market. To achieve this, an SVAR model is constructed using quarterly data from 1985 to 2022, which includes the Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) index, real GDP, CPI, unemployment rate, federal funds rate (FFR), and housing price. The results show that a positive shock in EPU negatively affects housing prices in the short term. Additionally, a positive shock in US housing prices negatively affects EPU and unemployment rate, while positively impacting real GDP and CPI change rates and interest rates. These findings align with previous studies, but some differences can be attributed to country-specific factors. To better un- derstand how EPU and the economy impact the local housing market, granular data should be used. Lastly, two additional models are introduced to evaluate the benchmark model. First, the Smooth Transition Covariance method is used to test the ranking of variables. Second, the unit root issue of FFR is inspected by substituting the first-differenced variables into the benchmark model.
