Abstract: This study investigates the impact of U.S. Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) on its economy and how EPU and the macroeconomy influence its housing market. A Structural Vector Autoregression model is constructed using quarterly data from 1985 to 2022, which includes EPU, real GDP (RGDP), CPI, Unemployment Rate, Federal Funds Rate (FFR), and U.S. median housing price (MSPUS). The results show that a positive EPU shock negatively affects MSPUS in the short term. A positive shock in MSPUS also lowers the unemployment rate while positively impacting CPI and FFR. In addition, two additional models are introduced to evaluate the benchmark model. First, the Smooth Transition Covariance method is used to test the ranking of variables. Second, the unit root issue of FFR is inspected by substituting the first-differenced variables into the benchmark model.
